When adding a name to the list for a `letsEncrypt` property, certbot fails thusly:

Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
Plugins selected: Authenticator webroot, Installer None
Missing command line flag or config entry for this setting:
You have an existing certificate that contains a portion of the domains you requested (ref: /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/fusionapp.com.conf)

It contains these names: fusionapp.com, bn.fusionapp.com, bz-entropy.fusionapp.com, bz-ext.fusionapp.com, bz.fusionapp.com, entropy.fusionapp.com, prod.fusionapp.com

You requested these names for the new certificate: fusionapp.com, entropy.fusionapp.com, bz-entropy.fusionapp.com, bz-ext.fusionapp.com, prod.fusionapp.com, bz.fusionapp.com, bn.fusionapp.com, entropy.fusiontest.net.

Do you want to expand and replace this existing certificate with the new certificate?

(You can set this with the --expand flag)
