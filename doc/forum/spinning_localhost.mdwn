I have several machines that don't have internet facing domain-names / IP addresses. They can pull, but they (easily) can't be pushed to. I guess I can manually spin them (or run cron jobs). I guess I need to manually add a unique hostname to each /etc/hosts, which sounds like a job for propellor, not for a human. Does anyone have any good setups to share for this kind of scenario?
