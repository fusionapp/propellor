propellor 5.3.6 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Fix build with ghc 8.4, which broke due to the Semigroup Monoid change.
   * Dropped support for building propellor with ghc 7 (as in debian
     oldstable), to avoid needing to depend on the semigroups transitional
     package, but also because it's just too old to be worth supporting.
   * stack.yaml: Updated to lts-9.21.
   * Make Schroot.overlaysInTmpfs revertable
     Thanks, Sean Whitton
   * Update shim each time propellor is run in a container, to deal with
     library version changes.
   * Unbound: Added support for various DNS record types.
     Thanks, FÃ©lix Sipma."""]]
