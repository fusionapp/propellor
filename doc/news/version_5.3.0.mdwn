propellor 5.3.0 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Avoid bogus warning about new upstream version when /usr/bin/propellor
     is run on a Debian system, but ~/.propellor was not cloned from the
     Debian git bundle.
   * Parted: Allow partitions to have no filesystem, for eg, GPT BIOS boot
     partitions. (API change)
   * Added rawPartition to PartSpec, for specifying partitions with no
     filesystem.
   * Added BiosGrubFlag to PartFlag.
   * Add HasCallStack constraint to pickOS and unsupportedOS, so the
     call stack includes the caller.
   * Run su with --login, to avoid inheriting some problematic environment
     variables, such as TMP, from the caller.
   * Grub: Added properties to configure /etc/default/grub.
   * Laptop: New module, starting with powertopAutoTuneOnBoot."""]]
