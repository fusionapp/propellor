propellor 4.8.0 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * DiskImage: Made a DiskImage type class, so that different disk image
     formats can be implemented. The properties in this module can generate
     any type that is a member of DiskImage. (API change)
     (To convert existing configs, convert the filename of the disk image
     to RawDiskImage filename.)
   * Removed DiskImage.vmdkBuiltFor property. (API change)
     Instead, use VirtualBoxPointer in the property that creates the disk
     image.
   * Apt.isInstalled: Fix handling of packages that are not known at all
     to apt.
   * Borg: Converted BorgRepo from a String alias to a data type.
     (API change)
   * Borg: Allow specifying ssh private key to use when accessing a borg
     repo by using the BorgRepoUsing constructor with UseSshKey.
   * Borg: Fix broken shell escaping in borg cron job.
   * Attic: Fix broken shell escaping in attic cron job.
   * Make lock file descriptors close-on-exec.
   * Lvm: New module for setting up LVM volumes.
     Thanks, Nicolas Schodet"""]]
