propellor 5.5.0 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * letsencrypt': Pass --expand to support expanding the list of domains
   * Split mailname property out of Hostname.sane, since bad mailname
     guesses can lead to ugly surprises. (API change)
   * Removed HostingProvider.CloudatCost module as it lacks a maintainer.
     (If anyone would like to maintain it, send a patch adding it back.)
     (API change)
   * Added Systemd.escapePath helper function useful when creating mount
     units.
   * Added Sudo.sudoersDFile property.
   * Sudo.enabledFor: Write to /etc/sudoers.d/000users rather than to
     /etc/sudoers. (Any old lines it wrote to /etc/sudoers will be removed.)
     This fixes a potential ordering problem; the property used to append
     the line to /etc/sudoers, but that would override more specific lines
     in the include directory.
   * Borg: Added UsesEnvVar.
   * Added DiskImage.noBootloader, useful for eg, direct booting with
     qemu. Thanks, David Bremner.
   * Added Apt.backportInstalledMin."""]]
