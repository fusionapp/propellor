propellor 4.9.0 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * When the ipv4 and ipv6 properties are used with a container, avoid
     propagating the address out to the host.
   * DnsInfo has been replaced with DnsInfoPropagated and
     DnsInfoUnpropagated. (API change)
   * Code that used fromDnsInfo . fromInfo changes to use getDnsInfo.
   * addDNS takes an additional Bool parameter to control whether
     the DNS info should propagate out of containers. (API change)
   * Made the PropellorRepo.hasOriginUrl property override the repository
     url that --spin passes to a host.
   * PropellorRepo.hasOriginUrl type changed to include HasInfo. (API change)
   * Fstab.mounted: Create mount point if necessary, and mount it
     if it's not already mounted.
     Thanks, Nicolas Schodet
   * Properties that check for an empty directory now treat a directory
     containing only "lost+found" as effectively empty, to support
     situations where the directory is a mount point of an EXT* filesystem.
     Thanks, Nicolas Schodet
   * Make addInfo accumulate Info in order properties appear, not
     reverse order.
     This fixes a bug involving reverting Systemd.resolvConfed or
     Systemd.linkJournal."""]]
