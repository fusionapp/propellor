propellor 5.8.0 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Fix bug in File.containsShellSetting that replaced whole shell conffile
     content with the setting if the file did not previously contain a line
     setting the key to some value.
   * Removed inChroot, instead use hasContainerCapability FilesystemContained.
     (API change)
   * Hostname: Properties that used to not do anything in a systemd or
     docker container will now change the container's hostname,
     since it's namespaced.
   * Add User.ownsWithPrimaryGroup
     Thanks, Sean Whitton
   * Ssh.userKeys, Ssh.userKeyAt: Create .ssh directory when it does not yet
     exist.
   * Ssh.userKeyAt: When a relative filepath is provided, it's put inside
     the user's .ssh directory.
   * Fix Git.pulled always reporting a change.
     Thanks, Sean Whitton"""]]
