propellor 4.2.0 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * DiskImage.grubBooted no longer takes a BIOS parameter,
     and no longer implicitly adds Grub.installed to the properties of
     the disk image. If you used DiskImage.grubBooted, you'll need to update
     your propellor configuration, removing the BIOS parameter from
     grubBooted and adding a Grub.installed property to the disk image, eg:
         &amp; Grub.installed PC
     (API change)
   * Grub.installed: Avoid running update-grub when used in a chroot, since
     it will get confused.
   * DiskImage.Finalization: Simplified this type since it does not need to
     be used to install packages anymore. (API change)"""]]
