propellor 4.7.0 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Add Apt.proxy property to set a host's apt proxy.
     Thanks, Sean Whitton.
   * Add Apt.useLocalCacher property to set up apt-cacher-ng.
     Thanks, Sean Whitton.
   * Rework Sbuild properties to use apt proxies/cachers instead of
     bind-mounting the host's apt cache. This makes it possible to run more
     than one build at a time, and lets sbuild run even if apt's cache is
     locked by the host's apt.
     Thanks, Sean Whitton.
   * Sbuild: When Apt.proxy is set, it is assumed that the proxy does some
     sort of caching, and sbuild chroots are set up to use the same proxy.
   * Sbuild: When Apt.proxy is not set, install apt-cacher-ng, and point
     sbuild chroots at the local apt cacher.
   * Sbuild: Droped Sbuild.piupartsConfFor, Sbuild.piupartsConf,
     Sbuild.shareAptCache
     (API change)
     No longer needed now that we are using apt proxies/cachers.
   * Sbuild: Updated sample config in haddock for Propellor.Property.Sbuild.
     If you use this module, please compare both your config.hs and
     your ~/.sbuildrc with the haddock documentation.
   * Grub.bootsMounted: Avoid failing when proc sys etc are already mounted
     within the chroot."""]]
