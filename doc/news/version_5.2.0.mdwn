propellor 5.2.0 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
 * [ Joey Hess ]
   * bootstrappedFrom: Set up local privdata file.
   * Parted: Fix names used for FAT and VFAT partitions.
   * Parted: Add an Alignment parameter. (API change)
     A good default to use is safeAlignment, which is 4MiB,
     well suited for inexpensive flash drives, and fine for other disks too.
     Previously, a very non-optimial 1MB (not 1MiB) alignment had been used.
   * DiskImage: Use safeAlignment. It didn't seem worth making the
     alignment configurable here.
   * Fixed rounding bug in Parted.calcPartTable.
   * DiskImage: Fix rsync crash when a mount point does not exist in the
     chroot.
   * Fix bug in unmountBelow that caused unmounting of nested mounts to
     fail.
   * Grub.boots, Grub.bootsMounted: Pass --target to grub-install.
   * Added Propellor.Property.Installer modules, which can be used to create
     bootable installer disk images, which then run propellor to install
     a system. This code was extracted from the demo I gave in my
     talk at DebConf 2017.
 * [ Sean Whitton ]
   * Sbuild: add notes about Debian jessie hosts and backports of sbuild and
     autopkgtest."""]]
