propellor 5.4.1 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Modernized and simplified the MetaTypes implementation now that
     compatability with ghc 7 is no longer needed.
   * Use git verify-commit to verify gpg signatures, rather than the old
     method of parsing git log output. Needs git 2.0.
   * Added ConfFile.containsShellSetting, ConfFile.lacksShellSetting,
     and EtcDefault.set properties. Thanks, Sean Whitton
   * Dns: Support TXT values longer than bind's maximum string length
     of 255 bytes. Thanks, rsiddharth.
   * Docker and HostingProvider.CloudAtCost modules are not being
     maintained, so marked them as such.
     Seeking a maintainer for the Docker module; I anticipate
     removing the CloudAtCost module in the next API bump."""]]
