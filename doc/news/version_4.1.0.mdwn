propellor 4.1.0 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * User.hasInsecurePassword makes sure shadow passwords are enabled,
     so if the insecure password is later changed, the new password won't be
     exposed.
   * Bugfix: Apache.httpsVirtualHost' must create ssl/hn/ dir earlier
     Thanks, Sean Whitton.
   * Bootstrap.clonedFrom: Fix bug that broke copying .git/config into
     chroot.
   * Diskimage.imageExists: Align disk image size to multiple of 4096
     sector size, since some programs (such as VBoxManage convertdd)
     refuse to operate on disk images not aligned to a sector size.
   * Bootstrap.bootstrappedFrom: Fix bug that caused propellor to only
     be built from the bootstrapped config the first time.
   * Bootstrap.bootstrappedFrom: Avoid doing anything when not run in a
     chroot.
   * When provisioning a container, output was buffered until the whole
     process was done; now output will be displayed immediately.
   * LightDM.autoLogin: Make it require LightDM.installed.
     (minor API change as the type changed)
   * Propellor.Property.XFCE added with some useful properties for the
     desktop environment.
   * Added File.applyPath property.
   * Added File.checkOverwrite.
   * File.isCopyOf: Fix bug that prevented this property from working
     when the destination file did not yet exist."""]]
