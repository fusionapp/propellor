   * Apt: Debian has changed the name of the suite for testing security updates
     from testing to testing-security.
   * Apt: Also the suite for stable releases from bullseye on will be
     suffixed with "-security".
   * Apt.update: Pass --allow-releaseinfo-change when updating Unstable
     or Testing, so that code name changes that happen in those suites
     during a stable release don't prevent updating the rolling suites.
   * Systemd.machined: Fix a bug that caused the systemd-container package
     to not be installed when used with Debian buster."""]]
