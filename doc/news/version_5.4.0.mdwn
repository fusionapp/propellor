 * [ Sean Whitton ]
   * Apt.installedBackport replaced with Apt.backportInstalled.  (API change)
     The old property would install dependencies from backports even when
     the versions in stable satisfy the requested backport's dependencies.
     The new property installs only the listed packages from backports;
     all other dependencies come from stable.
     So in some cases, you may need to list additional backports to install,
     that would not have needed to be listed before. Due to this behavior
     change the property has been renamed so uses of it will be checked.
   * Restic.installed: stop trying to install a backport on jessie, because no
     such backport exists."""]]
