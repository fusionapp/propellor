[Propellor](https://propellor.branchable.com/) is a
configuration management system using Haskell and Git.
Each system has a list of properties, which Propellor ensures
are satisfied.

This repository contains the Propellor configuration for
[Fusion](https://fusionapp.com/) infrastructure, and is probably not of
interest to anyone else.
